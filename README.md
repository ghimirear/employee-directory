# employee-directory 
**employee-directory** is a **react.js** based simple app. As a business manager you may need to see your employee,
search your employee for quick look and you may need to arrange them in order for easier acess to all employees.
This app allows user to search employee by fist name or last name or phone number and able to arrange them in alphabetical order by employees first name.
We are not using any databases for this project so we are simulating the database by bringing the user from api call fron [random-user](https://randomuser.me/documentation#howto). Each call gives you random user on which we can work on like the regular database.
